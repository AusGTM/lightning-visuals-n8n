# Project State

## Current Position

Phase: 40 (Scoring Engine, Veto & Parity Remediation) — EXECUTING
Next: Phase 40 remaining plans (40-06 tier/veto workflow, 40-07 backfill mechanism — waves 2+).
Status: Executing Phase 40 — Plans 01-05 complete
Last activity: 2026-08-07 — 40-05 complete (Geography/Annual Revenue flows retargeted to canonical properties, veto branch deleted — D-01 handover complete, n8n pipeline is the sole veto writer; ENGINE-03/ENGINE-04 closed; stale-flag population measured at zero)
Path decision: fix-the-four-workflow-chain-in-place — see `.planning/phases/39-path-decision-fit-score-verification/39-DECISION.md`

## Decisions

- [Phase 40-01]: D-05 round-trip verdict PROVEN — `PUT /automation/v4/flows/{id}` accepts STATIC_BRANCH action-content edits live; no portal-UI fallback needed for this edit shape. IS_BETWEEN edits (40-05) remain unverified.
- [Phase 40-01]: Corrected D-07's literal step order — validate-on-disposable must run while the flow is enabled, not disabled (a disabled flow never fires). Documented in PORTAL-FACTS.md for 40-04/40-05/40-06 to follow.
- [Phase 40-01]: ENGINE-06 fully closed; ENGINE-05 only half-closed (org-type branch no longer double-deducts gambling, but the real lv_is_gambling_operator-driven -20 component is still 40-04's work — do not mark ENGINE-05 complete until then).
- [Phase ?]: Task 1 checkpoint resolved: merge-then-cut (operator, 2026-08-06) — feat/v0.6-plugin-entrypoint merged into master via --ff-only, feat/v0.7-scoring-remediation cut from master (D-09).
- [Phase ?]: git push origin master skipped this session (sandbox denied it) — local master is ahead of origin/master; push deferred to operator/orchestrator.
- [Phase ?]: 39-03: FLIP_PROPERTY_NAME chosen as lv_org_type (taxonomy-controlled, matches 39-04's example criterion) since the plan left the concrete flip property unspecified.
- [Phase ?]: 39-03: DECIDE-01 left unmarked in REQUIREMENTS.md — spans all 4 plans, completes only when 39-DECISION.md lands in 39-04.
- [Phase 39-02]: Availability verdict AVAILABLE (company fit-score confirmed on Sales Hub Pro, portal 22617666) — but operator overrode CONTEXT.md D-05's lead-scoring-tool preference mid-plan, locking the path to fix-the-four-workflow-chain-in-place on an lv_icp_fit_score architecture-reuse requirement the lead-scoring tool cannot satisfy. Full decision record still lands in 39-04's 39-DECISION.md.
- [Phase 39-02]: Task 2's in-portal walkthrough was performed by the orchestrator driving the operator's own logged-in Chrome session, at the operator's live delegation — deviation from D-01's "operator drives it," recorded in VERIFICATION-NOTE.md's header; portal state/screenshots are authentic.
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 39-04]: Path verdict recorded: fix-the-four-workflow-chain-in-place (39-DECISION.md), decided on operator hard requirement to reuse lv_icp_fit_score/lv_icp_tier — availability gate resolved AVAILABLE but was not the deciding factor.
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 39-04]: Tasks 1 (armed recalc-latency probe) and 2 (band-c checkpoint) skipped as moot per operator override — D-04 gate applies only to the lead-scoring-tool path, which is not chosen. Documented as deviations in 39-DECISION.md's Process note.
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 40-02]: Live parity harness landed (PARITY-01/PARITY-02) — tests/scoring_fixtures.py + tests/test_scoring_parity.py + scripts/run_scoring_parity.py. All named -k selectors ready for 40-03..40-06; live tests intentionally RED until owning plans land.
- [Phase 40-03]: lv_anti_icp_flag/lv_anti_icp_reason ported into ENRICH_DECIDE_CO_CLOUD (D-01), byte-identical to src/icp_scoring.py's hard-veto block; DEFAULT_COMPANY_POLICY's veto entries hardened to min_confidence:80 (D-04/P2 closed). Operator armed the deploy and bounced the affected workflows — confirmed live.
- [Phase 40-03]: **BLOCKER (pre-existing, not caused by this plan) — ALLOW_HUBSPOT_RECORD_WRITES is baked "false" in every build** (scripts/build_cloud_workflows.py's WRITE_SAFETY_DEFAULTS). No enrichment run can PATCH a real HubSpot record until this is flipped, rebuilt, and redeployed — a deliberate rollout-gate decision, not something 40-03 should flip unilaterally. 40-05 must NOT delete the Geography flow's veto branch until this is resolved and a live write is confirmed landing, or the portal will have zero working veto writers (T-40-11's DoS scenario). See WINDOWS.md id 2, 40-03-SUMMARY.md's Live Validation Findings.
- [Phase 40-03]: **BLOCKER (pre-existing) — SJ-3's dispatch to "LV Enrichment (Cloud template)" errors "Missing node to start execution"** (live executions 1891/1893) because that workflow's only entry point is a Webhook Trigger, not an Execute Workflow Trigger. The 15-min lv_enrichment_requested poller (D-02's documented refresh path) never reaches enrichment. Blocks SJ-1/SJ-2/SJ-3 broadly, not just the veto. See WINDOWS.md id 3.
- [Phase 40-03]: VETO-01/VETO-02 left unmarked in REQUIREMENTS.md — code is fully verified (offline+live-webhook-execution) but the plan's own bar (a live PATCH landing on a real record) could not be met due to the two blockers above.
- [Phase 40-04]: The other three `*_score` components' default-0-on-creation stamp is not reproducible via the CRM v3 Properties API (`defaultValue` silently dropped on POST and PATCH, `numberDisplayHint` PATCH also had no effect) — live-probed three ways before concluding this. Live-confirmed via a reversible formula spike that this matters: `lv_icp_fit_score`'s `calculation_equation` formula blanks entirely when one referenced term is null, not treats it as 0. Fixed by giving `produces_content_score`/`gambling_score`'s new mapper flows a second enrollment branch on `createdate` known, feeding the existing default branch — stays inside the API-only D-05/D-08 path, no portal-UI needed. Does not retroactively affect any of the 712 pre-existing companies (per 40-01's enrollment-requires-a-future-event finding).
- [Phase 40-04]: `lv_icp_fit_score` extended from 3 to 5 terms (`+ produces_content_score + gambling_score`) via a single clean PATCH (no 400, no portal-UI fallback). ENGINE-02 and ENGINE-05 closed. The remaining gap to ENGINE-01's 80/A total is exactly 40-05's geography/revenue retarget, unchanged by this plan.
- [Phase 40-05]: **Blocker resolved before this plan started** — `VETO-WRITE-EVIDENCE.md` (2026-08-06/07) live-proves both WINDOWS.md #2 (ALLOW_HUBSPOT_RECORD_WRITES) and #3 (SJ-3 dispatch) are fixed: a real HubSpot PATCH landed `lv_anti_icp_flag="true"` via the scheduled-arm companion, independently re-verified, window disarmed after. This satisfied the precondition the old blocker below (now cleared) was guarding.
- [Phase 40-05]: Both Geography (4626722240) and Annual Revenue (4626722237) flows retargeted to their canonical trigger properties (`lv_country_region_normalized`, `lv_revenue_band`) and the Geography flow's veto branch deleted — D-01 complete, n8n pipeline is now the sole writer of `lv_anti_icp_flag`/`lv_anti_icp_reason`, guarded by a permanent conformance test scanning every archived flow. ENGINE-03/ENGINE-04 closed.
- [Phase 40-05]: Live-discovered two HubSpot Automation v4 API limits not previously documented: (1) converting an action's `type` from `LIST_BRANCH` to `STATIC_BRANCH` via PUT 400s — worked around by keeping `LIST_BRANCH` and editing its `MULTISTRING IS_EQUAL_TO` filter content instead, staying on the API-only path with no portal-UI fallback needed; (2) a flow's PUT rejects reintroducing any `actionId` that existed in an earlier revision of that same flow but is absent from the current PUT body, even with no orphans and unique targets — resolved by using ids never before used by that flow. See `PORTAL-FACTS.md`'s Plan 05 section for full detail.
- [Phase 40-05]: Task 3's blocking checkpoint auto-resolved per operator pre-approval (2026-08-07), citing `VETO-WRITE-EVIDENCE.md`. Read-only measurement performed instead of the checkpoint's real-record-refresh step: stale `lv_anti_icp_flag=true` population is **zero** across all 711 companies (not "unknown" as originally framed) — no company in this portal has ever had the flag written by any source, consistent with `ALLOW_HUBSPOT_RECORD_WRITES` having been false for the whole phase until the one now-deleted disposable exception.
- [Phase 40-05]: `tests/test_scoring_parity.py::test_f4_au_string_is_not_vetoed` corrected (Rule 1) to assert `lv_anti_icp_flag != "true"` rather than `== "false"` — a direct, in-scope consequence of D-01's completion (HubSpot no longer writes the flag at all, so a bare disposable patch leaves it `None`, not `"false"`). Matches this plan's own Task 1 acceptance bar verbatim.
